                        <div class="spacer-15"></div>
                        <p class="lead">CO150’s aim, in addition to improving writing, research, and critical thinking skills, 
                        is to prepare students to write effectively in differing contexts, across disciplines, 
                        and for various audiences—both within the university and in any of the increasingly 
                        communication-dependent environments (both personally and professionally) that students 
                        find themselves in today. </p>

						<p>Writing effectively means becoming a critical consumer and producer of information 
						through active reading/listening, thoughtful inquiry, diligent research, and informed 
						contribution to a conversation. CO150 frames writing in terms of <strong>joining a conversation,</strong>
						a metaphor for learning to “listen” before speaking or writing, and then contributing 
						something meaningful and relevant to the discussion. By considering the demands of the 
						rhetorical situation and broader conversation, students will improve the <strong>purpose, focus, 
						audience appeal, organization,</strong> and <strong>style and mechanics</strong> of their writing. </p>
					

						<p>The focus of CO150 is <strong>rhetoric.</strong> While the word is worthy of complex, book-length 
						definitions, the core understanding of rhetoric involves comprehension of what words DO in addition 
						to what they state. Throughout the semester, students will build skills to both recognize and use the 
						rhetorical strategies for persuasion and argumentation. </p>

						<p>To ground our study of rhetoric, we will read, write, and discuss topics and issues 
						related to our course theme, <strong>Ethics in Higher Education.</strong> As you learn to sift 
						through ideas, evidence, claims, assumptions, values, and opinions, you will be asked to 
						consider how something is said as much as what is said. We have done our best to include a 
						representative range of the voices in the readings for the class.  By studying a variety of writers, 
						we will analyze how authors craft texts for particular audiences and purposes.</p>

                        <p><em>Key Objectives:</em></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Developing critical reading practices to support research and writing;</li>
							<li>Understanding writing as a rhetorical practice, ie choosing effective strategies for addressing purpose, audience, and contexts;</li>
							<li>Learning important elements of academic discourse, such as posing and critically investigating questions, 
							using sources effectively and ethically, and writing effective summaries, analyses, and arguments;</li>
							<li>Increasing information literacy through strategies for locating, selecting, and evaluating 	sources for inquiry;</li>
							<li>Developing effective research and writing processes, including peer collaboration and response and using feedback to guide revision.</li>

                    <p class="color"><i class="ion ion-clock"></i><strong>TL;DR: you'll learn how to write better <em>for an audience, with an actual purpose</em> rather than willy-nilly; you'll also

                <h3>2.0 Grades</h3>
                <p>Projects will be assessed using a grading guide on the <a href="project.html"><u>project assignment sheet.</u></a>
                Generally, however, each essay is assessed using the hierarchy of rhetorical concerns. 
                (See assignment sheets and <a href="syllabus.html#diagrams"><u>Section 8 for helpful diagrams.</u></a>) </p>
               <p> It is expected that all assignments will be carefully prepared and proofread. 
                Unless otherwise noted, all assignments will be typed using 12-point, Times or Arial font, 
                double-spaced, 1-inch margins, numbered pages, and nicely stapled. MLA format and guidelines must 
                be used for all applicable assignments. </p>
                
                <p><strong>Project deadlines mean that papers must be submitted

                <h3>3.0 Attendance / Tardies Policy</h3>
                <p>Attendance and participation are not only vital for your success, they’re vital for the success of the class as a whole. 
                This course is constructed with the idea that writing is a process; the work we do in class contributes significantly 
                to the process of writing that culminates in each unit with the major projects. Missing class forfeits your opportunity 
                to add to discussions and help spread out the writing process in ways that make writing major projects more more efficient and successful.</p>
                
                <em>How I take attendance / make up work</em>
                <ul>
					<li>Starting on the third day of class, I will take attendance every day by handing around a sign-in sheet. It is your responsibility to sign the attendance sheet for class each day since this is the proof of your attendance. If you have not signed the attendance sheet, that means you were not in class. </li>
					<li>If you are absent, you cannot make up any in-class work we did that day (e.g. group work,  discussion, quizzes, in-class writing activities, workshop, etc.).  </li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Please communicate with me if there are any extenuating circumstances that may affect your attendance. </strong></p>

				<em>Tardies</em>
				<p>Be on time and prepared for class each day. Entering late harms our classroom community by interrupting class, 
				distracting your peers and instructor from the learning process, and causing you to miss important information. 
				<strong>If you are late to class and miss handing in homework, a quiz, in-class writing, or similar activity, you cannot make it up. </strong> 
				Also, please do not leave early or start packing up your notebooks and backpacks before class is over.</p>
				
				<p class="color"><i class="ion ion-clock"></i><strong>TL;DR: Showing up to class (and on time) is in your best interest.</strong></p>

        <!-- Assignments Section -->
        <section id="assignments" class="ptb-15">
            <div class="wow fadeIn container text-left">
                <h3>4.0 Assignments / Due Dates</h3>
                <p>You are responsible for knowing what assignments are due, when they are due, what assignments you may have missed, 
                and what in-class handouts you need to obtain. Due dates for major projects are at the top of your assignment sheets, 
                on this syllabus, and posted on Canvas; due dates for process work/homework are posted Canvas, usually on a day-by-day basis.</p>

				<p>Due dates are not “optional,” nor are they “suggestions.” They are real; respect them. All assignments are due at the 
				beginning of class—most must be uploaded to Canvas or emailed directly to me prior to the beginning of class, unless otherwise stated. 
				Problems with technology are no excuse for missing a due date; you should buffer in time for computer malfunctions such as poor 
				internet connection or an inkless printer. Also, save your work in multiple places to alleviate the stress of computer failure. </p>

				<p>I do not accept late work for full credit. However, see <a href="syllabus.html#timemachine">TIME MACHINE Section</a> for your optional one extension on a major project. </p>

				<p>Absence does not excuse you from turning in an assignment. If forced to miss a class on a due date (for an excused absence or unexcused), that assignment must be turned in ahead of time to receive credit.</p>
				
				<p class="color"><i class="ion ion-clock"></i><strong>TL;DR: Turn in your stuff on time. I don't take late work.</strong></p>  

				<h3>4.1 In-Class Assignments / Participation</h3>
				<p>We will often have in-class writing and group discussion activities. I provide these instructions and often handouts to accompany this graded process work. It is your responsibility to pick up hand-outs and turn-in hand-outs at the end of class to receive credit for your effort and participation.</p>

                <p>Please respect your peers and your instructor through your civility in class. It is quite likely that we will broach sensitive, charged, controversial topics. 
                Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that civility and respect be employed at all times. Respect the opinions of other students and the authors we read (even if you don’t agree). 
                I reserve the right to dismiss any student who disrupts class. Please bring any concerns to my attention immediately.</p>
                
				<p>Please hold each other accountable for the use of technology in the classroom. Cell phones and other devices might prove useful for coursework, 
				but they can also distract you and others. Please be considerate and silence your ringer and refrain from texting in class.</p>
				
				<p>I do not mind if you politely excuse yourself should you have a communication need in the case of an emergency or any pressing academic, family, or professional matter.</p>
				<p class="color"><i class="ion ion-clock"></i><strong>TL;DR: Be a respectful human adult, not a meany-pants who's rude to folks or a cyborg attached to your phone.</strong></p>

                <h3>5.1 Academic Honesty</h3>
                <p>Plagiarism will not be tolerated in this class. Any instance of plagiarism will result in a reduced or failing grade of the assignment, failure of the course, 
                and/or removal of the Repeat/Delete option for the course. Ignorance is not an excuse for “accidental” plagiarism.</p>
				<em>The following are examples of plagiarism (though this list is not exhaustive):</em>
	
				<ul>
					<li>Submitting someone else’s work as your own;</li>
					<li>Submitting a paper that was purchased or downloaded from the internet;</li>
					<li>Using someone else’s ideas, language, or structure and not properly attributing them;</li>
					<li>Using a phrase (whether quotation or paraphrase) without acknowledging its source;</li>
					<li>Using a source without citing it correctly;</li>
					<li>“Padding” a bibliography by making up sources or citing a source you didn’t use in your research.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>To encourage academic honesty in all assignments, each major assignment will require that you include an Honor Pledge indicating that you have not given, received, or used any unauthorized assistance.  On each major project, you will write the following honor pledge: </p>
					<blockquote>“I have not given, received, or used any unauthorized assistance.”</blockquote>
				<p>This honor pledge supersedes any requirement to submit any work to an online plagiarism detection database; I do not require that you use these services. I encourage an atmosphere of mutual respect 
				for the intellectual property of your work, your peers’ work, and the work of other authors whom you attribute in your research. 
				The accountability for your work is based on my assessment and your integrity, not a for-profit software service that may or may not accurately 
				detect legitimate cases of plagiarism. </p>
				<p>This class adheres to the Academic Integrity Policy of the General Catalog and the Student Code of Conduct.  Please see these documents for further details. 
				In cases of suspected academic dishonesty, all instructors at CSU are required to forward documentary evidence to the <a href="http://www.conflictresolution.colostate.edu/" target="_blank"><u>Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services. </u></a>
				This office will ensure due process and advise instructors regarding appropriate disposition of the case.  </p>

                <p>Peer collaboration is vital to the writing process, since it’s 
                through collaborating with others that we see and understand things we might not have otherwise. 
                As such I schedule time to workshop every major writing assignment you will do this semester. </p>

				<p><strong>You must bring an 80% draft to every workshop.</strong> This doesn’t mean a “final” or a “perfect” draft 
				– it means having a draft that is at least 80% of the minimum word count for the project so that you can get adequate 
				feedback on your ideas from your peers.  <em>(For example, if the final draft of an assignment must be minimum 1200 words, 
				the workshop draft must be minimum 960 words.)</em></p>

				<em>I grade workshop participation using two criteria: </em>
				<ol>
					<li>Submitting your draft on Canvas ahead of time for length</li>
					<li>Attending and actively engaging with the workshop </li>
				</ol>
				
				<p class="color"><i class="ion ion-clock"></i><strong>TL;DR: You'll have a workshop before each major project. Submit your draft online. Come to class and give effective feedback to your peers.</strong></p>

                <h3>6.2 Title IX Resources</h3>
                <p>CSU’s Student Sexual Harassment and Violence policy, following national guidance 
                from the Office of Civil Rights, requires that faculty follow CSU policy as a 
                “mandatory reporter” of any personal disclosure of sexual harassment, abuse, 
                and/or violence related experiences or incidents shared with the faculty member 
                in person, via email, and/or in classroom papers or homework exercises. These 
                disclosures include but are not limited to reports of personal relational abuse, 
                relational/domestic violence, and stalking. While faculty are often able to help 
                students locate appropriate channels of assistance on campus (e.g., see the 
                CSU Health Network link below), disclosure by the student to the faculty member 
                requires that the faculty member inform appropriate CSU channels to help ensure 
                that the student’s safety and welfare is being addressed, even if the student 
                requests that the disclosure not be shared. </p>
                
				<p>For counseling support and assistance, please see the CSU Health Network, 
				which includes a variety of counseling services that can be accessed at: 
				<a href="http://www.health.colostate.edu/" target="_blank"><u>health.colostate.edu</u></a></p>
				
				<p>And, the Sexual Assault Victim Assistance Team is a confidential student 
				resource that does not have a reporting requirement and that can be of great 
				help to students who have experienced sexual assault. The web address is
